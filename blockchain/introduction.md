# blockchain

Three fundamental characteristics that define a blockchain:

- (1) Validation
- (2) Verification
- (3) Consensus

## What is blockchain about?

Enabling peer-to-peer transactions in a decentralized network

Enabling trust among unknown peers

Recording the transactions in an immutable distributed ledger

Peers do not necessarily know each other.

## How to establish trust among the peers?

Process Validate/Verify/Confirm the transactions

Record the transactions in a distributed ledger of logs

Create a tamper-proof record of blocks (chain of blocks)

Implement a consensus protocol for agreement on the next block to be added to the chain

## basic operations

- Verify transactions
- Broadcast transaction
- Compete to create a block
- Reach consensus by validating block
- Broadcast new block
- Confirm transactions
